# Stealer Functions

### roblox_cookies.py
- Searches for Roblox session cookies (`.ROBLOSECURITY`) across multiple browsers, tries them against the Roblox API to retrieve account data, and writes found accounts into a file inside a ZIP.

### browser_steal.py
- Scans browser profiles to extract extensions, saved passwords, cookies, history, downloads and card data; decrypts when needed and writes those items to files inside a ZIP.

### discord_token.py
- Searches for Discord tokens in local browser/client files and databases, validates those tokens with the Discord API, collects account details (username, id, billing, Nitro, etc.), and records them to a file.

### interesting_files.py
- Searches user folders (Desktop, Downloads, Documents, Recent, etc.) for files with keyword names related to accounts, wallets, keys, backups, and copies those files into an **“Interesting Files”** folder inside the ZIP.

### Anti_VM_Debug.py
- Runs anti-analysis checks: detects active debuggers, reverse-engineering processes, usernames/hosts/HWIDs associated with virtual machines or analysis environments, and returns `true` if signs of VM/debugging are found.

<br>

# Bypass AV and Ofuscation

### marshal.py
- Compiles the code, serializes it with the marshal module, encodes it in base64 (and optionally compresses it with zlib), and generates a new script that, when executed, decodes and runs the original code in memory

<br>

# Result

### pyinstaller + marshal compress = true
